Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to deliver a series of tools to facilitate the manipulation 
and usage of hexagonal raster grids. These tools rely on the 
[Hexagonal ASCII file format](https://github.com/ldesousa/HexAsciiBNF) 
(or HASC for short) for the physical storage of hexagonal rasters.

 - **hasc2gml** - from an input HASC file creates a GML file with a vector feature for each hexagonal cell. Simplifies the display of hexagonal rasters in common desktop GIS software.
 
 - **asc2hasc** - creates an HASC file from an input ESRI ASCII grid. It can either preserve cell area or approximate spatial resolution.
 
 - **surface2hasc** - creates an HASC file from a continuous surface function.
 
 - **surface2asc** - creates an ESRI ASCII file from a continuous surface function.
 
This tool suite can be installed from the PyPi repository [1].

Future work includes the development of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for 
these tools on QGIS, making the usage of hexagonal grids even simpler.

Software dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `hasc2gml` script requires the GDAL library. On Debian based systems it can
be installed with the following command:

`apt install python-gdal` 

It can also be installed from the PyPi repository (the best option for virtual 
environments):

`pip instal GDAL`
